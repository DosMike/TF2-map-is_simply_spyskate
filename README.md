# is_simply_spyskate

This is a gameplay test map for Ice Skate maps, inspired by the CS:S gamemode with the same name.

The main focus of the gamemode is on the movement; weapon/class limit, grappling hook, powerup mode or objectives are up for the mapper to decide.

This is a spy melee only deathmatch map.

There is a small example map (is_test) that should show you how to add skate and boost triggers.

The vscript should be able to handle slopes OKish, so go wild.
